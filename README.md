# Bankruptcy-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

# Introdution 
Bankruptcy prediction using machine learning techniques involves training models on historical data to forecast the likelihood of a company or individual going bankrupt. These models can analyze various factors, such as financial statements, market trends and economic indicators, to identify patterns and predict future outcomes.

The objective was to explore and compare different classification models for early warning systems in financial risk assessment.
🔍 Key Highlights:
Dataset: Bankruptcy data containing financial ratios and indicators from Polish companies.

Problem: Binary classification — predicting whether a company is likely to go bankrupt.

# Models Used:
✅ Decision Tree Classifier — Simple and interpretable, good as a baseline.

🌲 Random Forest — Improved accuracy through ensemble learning and reduced overfitting.

🚀 Gradient Boosting — Best overall performance with fine-grained learning on difficult samples.

📊 Metrics Tracked: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

 🔁 Cross-Validation used to ensure model generalizability.
 
💡 Key Insight: Boosting models provided the best balance between precision and recall — essential when predicting rare but high-impact events like bankruptcy.
This project deepened my understanding of ensemble methods and the importance of model interpretability in high-stakes domains like finance.

🛠️ Tools: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
